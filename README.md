# Emotion Detection from Behind-the-Ear PPG Signals

This project implements deep learning models for **emotion recognition using PPG signals collected from a behind-the-ear wearable device**.  
It is based on our published paper:

ðŸ“„ Fatima Zahra *et al.*, **"Emotion Recognition from Behind-the-Ear PPG Signals Using Deep Learning"**, [Journal/Conference name, Year].  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `preprocess.py` â†’ Filtering (Butterworth), normalization.  
- `model.py` â†’ 1D-CNN architecture for emotion classification.  
- `train.py` â†’ Training script (requires dataset access).  
- `predict.py` â†’ Inference on test PPG signals.  
- `requirements.txt` â†’ Python dependencies.

## ðŸš€ Usage
### 1. Train
```bash
python train.py
```
(Add your dataset loader in `train.py`.)

### 2. Predict
```bash
python predict.py --weights ppg_emotion_model.pth
```

## ðŸ§  Techniques Used
- Preprocessing: Butterworth bandpass filtering, normalization.  
- Model: 1D-CNN for temporal features (5 emotions: happy, sad, angry, calm, fear).  
- Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.
